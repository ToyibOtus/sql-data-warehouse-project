## Project Requirements

### Build a Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective

Create a mordern **data warehouse using SQL server** to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

##### Specifications

* **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (CRM and ERP), provided as CSV files.
* **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issue prior to analysis.
* **Integration**: Consolidate both data from data sources into user friendly data, enabling analytical queries.
* **Scope**: Focus on latest data only; no historization allowed.
* **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support business stakeholders and analytical teams.

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source system, enabling traceability and debugging.
2. **Silver Layer**: Sstores cleaned, prepared, and transformed data. It is designed to support analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses buesiness-ready data modeled into a star schema, supporting reporting and analytics.
